make the dividers look better

how to get pixelated lines: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/jftj4m/is_it_possible_to_draw_pixelated_2d_lines_to/g9mhjbt/
try it maybe

add sound effects

AI improvements:
	
	fix melee's blocking enemy line of sight
	
	awareness spreading between allies

add a volume slider

all melee attacks will boost you forward a bit when you use them, and also slow you for a bit while
they are active. this will make the weapons feel a lot more heavy

better player death:
	player becomes a grave or corpse, and/or some kind of animation is played
	"press space to retry"
	the game world will still continue on as normal, all entities will ignore you when dead

try to make it so that the ysort on props works so they don't have to be on walls
(make a /r/godot post to get help with this maybe)

add screen shake, use it when you take damage or deal damage

make the game pause for a frame when you hit an enemy or take damage

player intro effect of them falling from the sky (use sprite offset for this)

----------------------------------
Version Beta 2.8 Release
	update the itch page
	download and make sure it works
	make an announcement on the discord server
----------------------------------

melee attacks have reqoil if they hit something

come up with a name for the game. don't continue until this step is complete

you are slowed while charging the bow

the player (and maybe in the future some enemies as well?) will have their held item be visible

particles:
	damage particles
	dust particles (from dashing)
	smoke (fire and bullet impact)
	muzzle flash (for pistol shooting)
	blood particles (for bleed effect)
	poison bubbles (for poison, maybe they come from green spikes as well)
	leaves (randomly spawns on fall levels)

use tweening a lot more in all the animations (more bouncy and fun)

fix input buffer (maybe even have an input buffer option in the settings)

add hitstun

make arrows leave an arrow effect (just a simple sprite that fades after awhile) if it hits a wall

give items some bouncy animations

make the hit effect spawn at the location of the HIT, instead of the location of the ENTITY
(maybe just guestimate the position by getting the average between the damage source and the target)

rename chasers faction to monster

----------------------------------
Version Beta 2.9 Release
	update the itch page
	download and make sure it works
	make an announcement on the discord server
----------------------------------

come up with actual names for the worlds, and use the first letter of the name for the letter

if I haven't yet, fix the .exe icon. i cannot let this stand

big fancy "you got a star!!1!" animation

all menu buttons / tickboxes / whatever will enlarge and rotate back and forth a bit when selected
(maybe even have some screen shake when they are selected)

better title screen
	big logo
	version number is in the corner
	below the logo is the update subtitle (i.e. "Magic and Melee")
	some fancy background animation (shaders??)

better zooming for pistol
(also make it slow you down)

make the itembar smaller

----------------------------------
Version Beta 2.10 Release
	update the itch page
	download and make sure it works
	make an announcement on the discord server
----------------------------------

fix some of the tiny problems on the maple wall tileset

make a generic entity sprite

make velocity work for effects

add little icons for different status effects the player has

rename Thing.gd to Attack.gd

add tent prop

make negative defense work (if it doesn't already?)

better intro:
	has a fake error (get a snip from the actual windows OS)
		maybe even use multiple snips from different OSs and have it match the correct one)
	then it explodes
	orange guy falls from the top and then walks off
	"created by NonGMOTrash"
	have a simple tune that plays during this whole thing (it's like 3 seconds long)

do a resprite of chasers to make them more distinct

----------------------------------
Version Beta 2.11 Release
	update the itch page
	download and make sure it works
	make an announcement on the discord server
	post on /r/godot
----------------------------------

(reminder: update patch notes)

add a xbow:

	3 damage + 1 in bleed
	only 1 shot and longish reload
	(should be better than bow though)

(reminder: update patch notes)

add a magic wand (standard blue, there will be elementral ones added later)
	semi automatic, shoots blue magic projectiles at a high rate
	no reload
	does all true damage, but has a lower DPS than the pistol still

add in the unused specter maze level

(reminder: update patch notes)

	works with bonus health
	consider using this for the player

(reminder: update patch notes)

remove the enviorment faction

make the brute chaser regenerate health

add a dagger:
	shorter than the sword
	faster than sword. 
	does 2 damage
	high risk high reward
	has dash attack as a secondary attack (like melee fox side b)
	4 damage, but leaves you more vulnerable and puts the weapon on cooldown

(reminder: update patch notes)

add new types of wands:
	
	earth:
		primary has 1 damage and poison, but is a bit slower
		raises a stone for secondary (does damage if something is under it but is also a barrier)
	
	(reminder: update patch notes)
	
	fire: 
		primary attack does 1 damage and spawns a fire, with a pretty fast speed
		has the firefox move from melee as the secondary (high damage and gives fire)
	
	(reminder: update patch notes)
	
	wind: 
		low dmg
		primary is fast and has super high knockback
		makes a cyclone for secondary that pulls things in (does a little damage if enemy is in the middle)

(reminder: update patch notes)

make new kingdom enemies that use the new weapons

(reminder: update patch notes)

make a slime enemy that duplicates itself everytime it takes damage (just like brogue)
also maybe make it lunge in bursts rather than move at a constant speed

(reminder: update patch notes)

make a new faction with new enemies, very similar to the existing kingdom faction
enemies will function the same but with slightly different stats, and they will have different colored sprites
they will be enemies of eachother, so i can make some epic kingdom battles

(reminder: update patch notes)

make specter death effect

make a misc folder (everything in level resources should go in there, maybe some other stuff also)

(reminder: update patch notes)

actually add in that specter maze level

low walls that block movement but not projectiles (the first one will be water)

(reminder: update patch notes)

add a rock:
	consumeable, you lose it once you throw it
	does 2 damage
	it drops after it hits something (set death_spawn of it's projectile to the rock item)

wood spikes:
	is always up. only triggers damage once when you first walk into one, and does only 1 damage.
	has a hurtbox so you can destory it. it's also highly flamable
	and it also takes damage when it hits something, but has very high health (~8)
	but the hurtbox has a +3 to damage so it will die quicker from hitting it

(reminder: update patch notes)

add a "spark", it's a tiny entity that will spawn a fire if it finds a fuel
maybe have fires spawn sparks instead of other fires

a health potion item:
	restores you to full health
	you can throw it to heal something for the secondary attack
