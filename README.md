# info

## can i share this game with other people?
please don't, i wanna keep this game sorta secret for now. if you violate this policy, i will do absolutely nothing except be very very sad. however when the game is out, please share this game with EVERYONE. just like, constantly

## .pck not found at path '.' error
teralite.exe has to be in the same folder as the teralite.pck or it won't work. if you want to have access to the game somewhere else, just make a shortcut of teralite.exe

## particles not working
if you're using a CPU with integrated graphics that doesn't support OpenGL ES 3, the game will fallback to OpenGL ES 2. this mostly works okay, but the game will run slower and particle effects won't work. sorry! i might make a "CPU particles" option in the future, but it would be a hassle because i would have to make a 2nd version of every particle effect

## old saves dissappeared
due to the name change from project epsilon to teralite in beta 2.12, the game won't be able to find the folder where old game data was stored.    
it's pretty easy to fix tho, just follow these steps:    
1. go to the search bar on windows and search %APPDATA% (should take you to a file folder)      
2. find the folder named "Project Epsilon" and rename it to "Teralite"   
3. if it asks you if you want to replace the folder that's already named Teralite, click Yes    
4. reopen teralite, and you should see your saves   
(you can also just cut and paste the actual save files from Project Epsilon into Teralite)

## compatiability with older saves
- all polish updates (+0.1 updates) should work fine with old saves		
- using an old save from a 1.X version is possible, but i recomend you just start over with a new save
- it will probably be a similar deal once 3.0 comes out but who knows
(in the future, i'll add an ingame warning for versions that aren't compatiable with eachother)

### how the version numbering works
i don't use semantic versioning because i suck    
instead, its: 

*Phase* **content**.**patch** *Hotfix*  

*Phase* is Alpha or Beta. if the version is after the official release, *Phase* is ommited  
**content** is only incremented for big content updates (although it starts at 1)   
**patch** is incremented for minor polish updates   
*Hotfix* isn't displayed unless there's a hotfix for that version. if there's multiple hotfixes for a version, a counter is added (i.e. Hotfix #2)
