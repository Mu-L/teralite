if you find a bug pls make an issue! i'm not really expecting any PRs - i mostly just opened sourced this game because it's free so why not... that said though, if you *do* actually go out of your way to fix or add something, i'll probably merge it.

i made this when i was much less experienced, mostly learning as a go along, so the code quality reflects that. many things were handeled poorly... but still, i hope this can be a useful example of what a non-trivial game project looks like.

# building the game

made using godot v3.6.1.
exports for windows, linux, and macos should all work, though the ladder two are *untested*
