teralite is a videogame. please play videogame https://nongmotrash.itch.io/teralite/

if you find a bug pls make an issue! i'm not really expecting any PRs - i mostly just opened sourced this game because it's free so why not.

i hope this code can maybe help you, although it's definitely not the cleanest... sorry!!

# building the game

use godot 3.5.3 (LTS) and export for windows desktop

other platforms (linux and macos) are *untested*, but should still work.
