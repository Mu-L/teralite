teralite is a videogame. please play videogame https://nongmotrash.itch.io/teralite/

if you find a bug pls make an issue! i'm not really expecting any PRs - i i mostly just opened sourced this game because it's free so why not.

i hope this code can maybe help you, although it's definitely not the cleanest... sorry!!

# building the game

use godot 3.5.3 (LTS)!!!!!! it should just work. i've had multiple people who have had trouble exporting the game and i have no idea why. wish i could be more help, sorry ;-;

also any platform other than windows desktop is UNTESTED, but should still work.
