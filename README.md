# project epsilon

please don't share these files, i wanna keep this game sorta secret for now. if you violate this policy... i will do abesolutely nothing. 

you can use an old save from a 1.X version, but levels have been changed and reordered so I recomend you just start over with a new save (besides, you'll only lose like 5 minutes of progress lol)

also, you have to keep the .exe has to be in the same folder as the .pck or it won't work. if you want to have access to it somewhere else, just make a shortcut of the .exe file

thanks for downloading

### how the version numbering works
i don't use semantic versioning because i suck    
instead, its: 

*Phase* **content**.**patch** *Hotfix*  

*Phase* is Alpha or Beta. if the version is after the official release, *Phase* is ommited  
**content** is only incremented for big content updates (although it starts at 1)   
**patch** is incremented for minor polish updates   
*Hotfix* isn't displayed unless there's a hotfix for that version. if there's multiple hotfixes for a version, a counter is added (i.e. Hotfix #2)
